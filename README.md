__Objective:__ Develop a small web application to support a Chatbot, you need to implement only the Frontend based on any web technology or framework that you already know or work daily; this application needs to consume APIs implemented in two REST Services already available in the backend to make the whole application work.

__Solution:__ Implement one-page application that has a button or image that opens a modal window or any other html object that gives the user the functionality of interacting with a Chatbot. Please use the following image as a guide of the application to be implemented.

The application can use any ajax library or framework to make the API calls for basically creating a session in Watson Assistant (one time) and then send the user inputs to be interpreted by the cognitive services. You will be given a [SoapUI project](./SoapUI-project/WatsonAssistantBasfServiceDesk-soapui-project.xml?inline=false) for guidance of the two REST Services that need to be called to build the application.

Regarding look & feel, you can use styles to your page.

__Expected delivery:__ You can deploy the solution in any cloud provider using a free user account (this is a plus) or send the application and clear instructions on how to install (including pre requisites) and run locally the application in a personal computer.
Finally, it is required to push your code to github in the following public project: [https://github.com/P1c4C0d3/basf_swd_test](https://github.com/P1c4C0d3/basf_swd_test)
